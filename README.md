# Hybrid Model of the OSTR

Project Description:
A coupled neutronics / thermal hydraulics hybrid model of the Oregon State TRIGA reactor. The goal of this project is to successfully construct a hybrid model and to be able to output solutions to changes in reactivity or other coefficients.
Each file in this project represents a function on our flow chart. Each of these files are later all connected to one another to create the entire model.

Coding Rules:
1. Write as few lines as possible to achieve goal
2. Always include comments where applicable
3. Avoid undefined/random numbers
4. Write variables out to what they fully represent, i.e. length_of_fuel_rod, initial_reactor_power, etc.
5. Avoid deep nesting if possible to improve code readibility and simplicity.
6. Have consistent grammar scheme, i.e. variables are lowercase while functions start with a capital. (This is something that isn't fully fleshed out yet)

Code Tasks:
The following are the designated tasks for each group member. This is a fluid list that will adapt and change over time as the needs of the project become more evident.
1. Cooling tower fan - Oden Armstrong
2. Primary HX - Oden Armstrong
3. Thermal hydraulic general oversight - Drake Martin
4. Validation of TH model - Drake Martin
5. Fuel temperature coefficient - Oden Armstrong
6. Moderator density coefficient - Drake Martin
7. Xenon reactivity - Gabe / Aidan
8. Control rod worth - Gabe / Aidan
9. Reactor kinetics - Aidan
10. Neutronics general oversight - Aidan / Gabe
11. Validation of neutronics model - Gabe
